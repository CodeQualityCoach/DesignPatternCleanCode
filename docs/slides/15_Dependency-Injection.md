# Design Pattern & Clean Code

## Dependency Injection

###### Thomas Ley | @CleanCodeCoach

---
# [DIP]

:exclamation: The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states that high level modules should not depend on low level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend upon abstractions. :exclamation:

# Goals

* DI & SL differences
* Lifetime scopes 
* Factory Pattern

---
# DI vs. SL

* [Dependency injection] (DI)
    * Injects dependencies
    * Contructor/property injection

* [Service Locator] (SL)
    * Single point of contact
    * Static dependency resolver.

---
# Demo

* Project [EUMEL Dj](https://github.com/EUMEL-Suite/EUMEL.Dj)

* Mobile app uses service locator
* Desktop app uses dependency injection.

---
# DI as SL

* Inject DI container
* Resolve dependency from container.

---
# Lifetime Scopes

* Unique-Instance context or scope
* Example
    * Per process
    * Per thread
    * Per HTTP request
    * Any customer defined 
* DI framework has already implementations.

---
# [Singleton]

* Instance is created once
* Instance is created on first use
* [Double-Check Locking]
* [MSDN Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/msp-n-p/ff650316(v=pandp.10))
* Implementation see Lazy<T>.

# Demo

- Project [src/Zapfenstreich.sln](https://github.com/CodeQualityCoach/DesignPatternCleanCode/tree/main/src)

---
# AD: `DI Frameworks`

- Reduces "hard dependencies"
- Delegates creation
- Simplifies injecting of code
- Simplifies changing of implementation

:point_up: A DI container makes you write cleaner software
:thumbsup: A DI container helps refactoring code.

---
# Factories

* Creates an *implemenentation*
* Returns an *interface*.

---
# [Factory] Implementations

* Class with `Create()` method(s)
* Interface with `Create()` method(s)
* Func<T> / Lambda.

---
# Lazy<T> vs. Func<T>

* Func<T> is a method which creates a T
* Lazy<T> implements a singleton
* Lazy gets a Func as constructor parameter
* Lazy can solve circular (DI) dependencies.
