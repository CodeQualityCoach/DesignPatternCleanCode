## Testable Code

# Goals

* Pattern for "testable code"
* Separate "untestable code".

---
# Unit tests

* Cost time and money
* Changes when code changed
* No value for the customer
* Learn an additional concept.

---
# Unit tests

* Not only check input --> output
* They define what happens in error-execution path
    * Logging
    * Return values
    * Rethrow exception?
* The document the usage of a class
    * Parameter usage
    * Return values
    * Expected behaviour.

---
# Unit tests

* Double check code
* Detect unwanted changes
* Keeps your code clean.

---
# About testing

* Myth: One assert per test
* Truth: One path per test.

---
# About testing

* Myth: Each method has a test method
* Truth: Each method will have multiple test methods
    * One "happy path"
    * Multiple "error path".

---
# Testing

* Brings all pieces together
* Clean code to test [SRP] classes
* [DIP] to mock dependencies.

---
# [Static Class Wrapper]

* Create Wrapper
* Extract interface

:point_up: Used for Static classes
:point_up: Used for classes without interface

---
# Mock HttpClient

* Create HttpClientWrapper
* Extract interface IHttpClient
* Create HttpClientMock
* Use interface and inject implementation

---
# Demo

- Project 

---
# Random(), DateTime()

* Same pattern applies to "changing" data
* Predict random numbers
* Change date time during test (e.g. test cache expiration)

---
# "Mocking" Frameworks

* NSubstitute
* System.Io.Abstractions
* [ContextFor<T>](https://codequalitycoach.de/posts/ContextFor-for-testing/)

---
# Demo

- Project 

---
# Architectural Tests

* Unit tests to verify architectural decisions
* E.g. Each class must have a test
* Operator methods must be virtual
